Abductive reasoning is used in Description Logics (DLs) to find the most likely reasons as to why an inference does not follow from a certain knowledge base. It starts with an observation, i.e. a  statement that cannot be inferred, and provides “missing” knowledge that explains why a certain ontology does not entail the observation. This is achieved by representing ontology expressions as trees and generating a mapping that preserves their structures. Mostly, there are standalone applications supporting abductive reasoning in ontologies. However, there is no standard tool support for generating explanations by abduction. Such an application would allow the implementation and use of different approaches of solving abduction problems in ontologies, and benefit users in extending and standardizing them. To this end, the goal of the thesis is to create an application (with a digital interface) that will obtain explanations for observations in ontologies and present them to users. The application would need to allow users to create, load, and manage ontologies and graphical representations of ontology expressions, as well as translate them to a standardized syntax. Further, the application would need to be able to call upon functions that provide explanations for observations w.r.t. an ontology.
